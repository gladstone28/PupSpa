LEARN INTERMEDIATE CSS
=======================
PupSpa
--------

This Project was aimed at putting to practice what we’ve learned about CSS Grid through building a classic, grid-based, responsive web page. 
Your friend has just opened a doggie daycare and grooming services shop, PupSpa. 
They would like a simple web page to let customers know about their services.

We currently have an HTML document styled with CSS, but every <div> appears in its own row. 
Let’s add some CSS grid properties to make parts of the site appear more cohesive. Some of the properties we’ll be using include:

1. display
2. grid-template-rows
3. grid-template-columns
4. gap
5. grid-column-start
6. grid-column-end

We’ll also cover a couple of the shorthand properties of these as well, here we go!
